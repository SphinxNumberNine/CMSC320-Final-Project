    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, competitive video games, otherwise known as esports, have become increasingly popular. What began as a cult phenomenon of nerds playing games at their local internet cafe's for a chance to win free food or a couple of bucks in the early 2000s has blossomed into a worldwide sensation that is honestly hard to comprehend. These days, multiple games have reached the level of being able to hold events in large traditional sports arenas like Madison Square Garden and the Oracle Arena. Prize purses for these events routinely break millions of dollars, and the players at the top of these games are treated like celebrities. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular esports titles throughout the 2010s has been Counter Strike: Global Offensive, commonly abbreviated CS:GO, a team-based tactical first-person shooter game played on PC. The game released in 2013, however earlier versions of the game have existed long before that, dating back to as early as 1999. CS:GO has, over its seven year tenure as an esports title, had hundreds of top level tournaments and hundreds of players and teams striving to call themselves the best. In this tutorial, we will go through the full data science pipeline as it relates to CS:GO's professional scene, attempt to answer a couple of questions through exploratory data analysis, and create a machine learning model by which future predictions about players and teams can be made.\n",

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary stats repository for CS:GO is [HLTV](https://hltv.org). They, as a company, have collected data on professional games dating back to the earlier versions of Counter Strike. And ever since late 2015, they have kept a team ranking based on performance over the previous few months. These rankings are the most universally accepted ranking system in the CS:GO community, and are (for the most part) treated as accurate. In addition to these rankings, HLTV has come up with a rating system to simplify all of the factors of a player's performance in a match to just a single number. This rating, commonly known as a player's HLTV rating, accounts for a myriad of factors in the game, including but not limited to, the number of eliminations a player gets in the match, the amount of times the player gets eliminated, the player's clutch plays (1vX scenarios), and how much damage the player is doing to the enemy team as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor that the HLTV rating does not take into account, however, is the skill level of the opposing team. Because of this, there are many players at the top level of the game who seemingly have high ratings, but upon further inspection of their match history, show a history of padding their stats against teams of a significantly lower calibre. I mention this because, looking ahead to the exploratory data analysis section of this tutorial, we will be attempting to answer the question \"who is CS:GO's most clutch player\", defining clutch as performing when it matters, against the better teams in the world. Keep this in mind as we start to scrape data, as it will be very useful when trying to understand why we are scraping certain things.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, since we are attempting to see which players perform against the best teams in the world, it makes sense to start by scraping historical ranking data, just so that when we get to scraping match data, we will have an established dataset of what each team was ranked at the time. One mild annoyance of this is that HLTV rankings are published weekly, on mondays, on a separate webpage every time, so we'll need to get crafty with the way we grab this data. First we're going to write a utility function that grabs every monday between the start of HLTV's rankings and 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice we've upper bounded the dates in this function to the end of 2019, just because the Covid-19 pandemic made the top level of CS:GO very erratic and unstable throughout 2020."

And since we're focusing on individual player performance, we're going to get our data from the [players section of HLTV](https://www.hltv.org/stats/players). The first step is to set our parameters, since HLTV has data from almost every professional CS:GO match ever played, including obscure semi-professional games. To try and eliminate outliers clouding up our data, we're going to set the match filter to LAN (since results achieved on a LAN setup hold much more weight in the eyes of the community than online games), and set the ranking filter to top 30 teams, as realistically we are looking for a player who has played at the highest level of the game. With these filters factored in, the URL we're going to be using to get the list of players is <https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?matchType=Lan&rankingFilter=Top30>. This link, however, doesn't give us the data we need. For that, we need to scrape individual player stats page URLs from this page, and grab our data from those individual pages (an example page for this would be <https://www.hltv.org/stats/players/7998/s1mple?matchType=Lan&rankingFilter=Top30>).

Lucky for us, every match we've logged into our dataframe has a \"date\" parameter, and we separated the weekly rankings into individual days earlier so all we have to do is write a utility function to accomplish this.

    "I think it's time we start thinking about the specific parameters of the question we're trying to solve. We are, in essence, trying to find out which CS:GO players play best at against all levels, not just players who pad their stats against weaker opposition. To do this, we're going to develop an \"importance\" metric for each match, based on the rank differential between the two teams. We will define this \"importance\" based on the following piecewise forumula:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>y = 2 for x < 1</center>\n",
    "<center>$y = \\frac{3}{x + 1} + 0.5$ for 1 <= x <= 5</center>\n",
    "<center>y = 1 for x >= 5</center>\n",
    "<center>Where y is the importance of a particular game and x is the rank differential between the teams</center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "To explain this a bit, if a team plays against a team higher ranked than them, the game will have an importance rating of 2 for the player in question. If a team plays against a team which is lower ranked than them, but is within the range of 1 < x <= 5, some importance will still be given to the game, but on a diminishing scale, as as the higher the differential is, the more we expect the higher ranked team to come out victorius. After the differential crosses 5, the game recieves an importance of 1, as the player in question's team is fully expected to win the match. \n",
